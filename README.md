# About rubberduck
rubberduck is based on the idea of [Rubberduck debugging] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Debugging large code bases can quickly become frustrating. It really helps to clear your thoughts by actually thinking about the code. Rubber duck allows you to do this by using the [5 Whys technique] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys). Usually digging in 5 levels deep should get you to the root cause.

Remember as Sherlock said "Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."

Alonsy!
